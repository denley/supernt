# Hardware tests

The console loads only `SYSTEM/CORES/spc.cor` (when an `.spc` file is played), so each test
swaps that file. `tools/sdcore` manages it: `setup` copies every test core into
`TESTCORES/NN-name.cor` on the card, `use NN` installs one, `list` shows which is installed.

Mount the card on homebox with `sudo mount -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8 /dev/sdX1 /mnt/sd`
(it shows up as a ~30 GB removable vfat disk in `lsblk`), and `sudo umount /mnt/sd` before
pulling it.

## Card state (21 Oct 2026)

- The card came with an older jailbreak release: everything matched JB7.2 except
  `spc.cor` (sha1 b03566d6…, Feb 2021). It has the same pinout as JB7.2's core.
  It is kept as `TESTCORES/99-stock-old-card.cor`.
- Whole-card backup from before any change: `~/scratch/sd-backup-2026-10-21`.
- Added `snt_firmware_verJB7.2.bin` in the root. There is no prompt: the console flashes it
  silently on power-on (a few minutes, LED flickers red, HDMI blacks out), then boots the menu.
  Denley's first boot with the card was slow, which fits. JB7.2 (Jul 2023) is still the latest
  release (github.com/analoguejb/Analogue-Super-Nt-JB). Check: Tools has "Reload Save RAM"
  (new in 7.2). The `.bin` was deleted from the card after the update.
- Installed `01-spc-colortest` as `spc.cor`, then `05-vtest`, then `07-buslog` rebuilt with
  the fixed sync order, then `09-q-snes` rebuilt with the confirmed sync/colour map (21 Oct evening).
- The card had no `.spc` files. `tools/mkspc.py` makes `SPC/Super Nt test chord.spc`: a steady
  A major chord (440/554/659 Hz square waves; checked with libgme). Copied to
  the card 21 Oct; `tools/sdcore setup` copies it too.

## Order

| # | core | look for |
|---|------|----------|
| 01 | spc-colortest | SPC player with scrambled colours, stable picture: modified cores load |
| 02–04 | spc-invert-ch1/2/3 | tint per core (cyan = red channel, magenta = green, yellow = blue) |
| 05/06 | vtest / q-vtest | 720p pattern in one of 6 sync orders, 8 s each; photo incl. corner boxes |
| 07/08 | buslog / q-buslog | hex log of the PIC32 link; film ~3 min |
| 09 | q-snes | green bar + 7 green test lines, white and cyan moving squares |
| 10/11 | plltest / blinky | only if 05/06 show nothing |
| 00 | stock JB7.2 | restore |

## Results

- 21 Oct 2026, JB7.2, `01-spc-colortest`: **loads and runs.** The SPC player UI showed and the
  test chord played. So the loader accepts a modified `spc.cor` (no hash or signature check, at
  least for a patch this small), and mkcor's frame handling is good on hardware. (A first "black
  screen" report was the file not being started properly.) Denley's description: "a wave pattern that said
  'super nt test' with various colours" (the player's visualiser and the ID666 title). Whether
  the colours were scrambled can't be told from that; vtest (next) settles whether our bits run.
- 21 Oct 2026, `05-vtest` (open-source flow, our own design): **picture.** About once a minute
  (one of the 6 sync orders), 4 boxes = order 3: P16 = VSYNC, M16 = DE, M18 = HSYNC. Stripes:
  green, red, blue groups, each with the last stripe brightest, so each group's bits are
  reversed relative to the proposal (mapping now in `notes/spc-core.md`). White block white.
  Photo: `photos/vtest-2026-10-21.jpg`. So: our bitstreams configure the FPGA, the 74.25 MHz W16
  clock is right, and the AD9889B is left configured for 720p RGB with separate syncs.
- 21 Oct 2026, `07-buslog` (fixed sync order): **works**; 3 photos, one per page, log full
  (1024 events). Transcription in `notes/buslog-2026-10-21/`. Repeating 5-state strobe cycle,
  one state carrying varying data; long stretches look like polling for a reply.
- 21 Oct 2026, `09-q-snes` (first Quartus core on the console), first build: nothing at all.
  Rebuilt to free-run for 20 s before frame-locking: **the SNES + SA-1 core runs**: green summary
  bar and 7 green test bars (all SA-1 tests pass), white and cyan squares moving, colours right;
  rolling slowly while free-running (60.000 Hz output vs 60.0988 Hz SNES); at 20 s, when the
  748/749-line frame lock started, the projector dropped the signal (blue "HDMI" no-signal
  screen). So Quartus-built cores load, the PLL works, and this projector rejects varying
  vertical totals. Fix: SNES clock 21.44196 MHz (0.16% slow) so SNES frames match 720p60 exactly.
