# Hardware tests

The console loads only `SYSTEM/CORES/spc.cor` (when an `.spc` file is played), so each test
swaps that file. `tools/sdcore` manages it: `setup` copies every test core into
`TESTCORES/NN-name.cor` on the card, `use NN` installs one, `list` shows which is installed.

Mount the card on homebox with `sudo mount -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8 /dev/sdX1 /mnt/sd`
(it shows up as a ~30 GB removable vfat disk in `lsblk`), and `sudo umount /mnt/sd` before
pulling it.

## Card state (21 Oct 2026)

- The card came with an older jailbreak release: everything matched JB7.2 except
  `spc.cor` (sha1 b03566d6…, Feb 2021). It has the same pinout as JB7.2's core.
  It is kept as `TESTCORES/99-stock-old-card.cor`.
- Whole-card backup from before any change: `~/scratch/sd-backup-2026-10-21`.
- Added `snt_firmware_verJB7.2.bin` in the root. There is no prompt: the console flashes it
  silently on power-on (a few minutes, LED flickers red, HDMI blacks out), then boots the menu.
  Denley's first boot with the card was slow, which fits. JB7.2 (Jul 2023) is still the latest
  release (github.com/analoguejb/Analogue-Super-Nt-JB). Check: Tools has "Reload Save RAM"
  (new in 7.2). Delete the `.bin` from the card next time it is in.
- Installed `01-spc-colortest` as `spc.cor`.
- The card had no `.spc` files. `tools/mkspc.py` makes `SPC/Super Nt test chord.spc`: a steady
  A major chord (440/554/659 Hz square waves; checked with libgme). Copied to
  the card 21 Oct; `tools/sdcore setup` copies it too.

## Order

| # | core | look for |
|---|------|----------|
| 01 | spc-colortest | SPC player with scrambled colours, stable picture: modified cores load |
| 02–04 | spc-invert-ch1/2/3 | tint per core (cyan = red channel, magenta = green, yellow = blue) |
| 05/06 | vtest / q-vtest | 720p pattern in one of 6 sync orders, 8 s each; photo incl. corner boxes |
| 07/08 | buslog / q-buslog | hex log of the PIC32 link; film ~3 min |
| 09 | q-snes | green bar + 7 green test lines, white and cyan moving squares |
| 10/11 | plltest / blinky | only if 05/06 show nothing |
| 00 | stock JB7.2 | restore |

## Results

- 21 Oct 2026, JB7.2, `01-spc-colortest`: **loads and runs.** The SPC player UI showed and the
  test chord played. So the loader accepts a modified `spc.cor` (no hash or signature check, at
  least for a patch this small), and mkcor's frame handling is good on hardware. (A first "black
  screen" report was the file not being started properly.) Colour scrambling not yet confirmed.
